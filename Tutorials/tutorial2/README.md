# NextJs

- Next js is framework of frontend and backend
- Next js have few more features on top of that like file-based routing, side server rendering(ssr), static site generation (ssg), a buit in router etc.

# File Based Routing in Next.js

- when we want to create enpoint, we can easily do that. is easy to do in next.
- we need to just add file in pages directory and we can access that file using localhost/filename in developermode. we dont need to use router, routes, routes like in react js.

## nested routes
- we can easliy create and access nested routes.
- we need create a folder like i.e covidapp and we can mention their our files or endpoint
- for accessing we need enter endpoint like localhost/dir/file. i.e "http://localhost:3000/covidapp/home"

## dynamic routes
- is good.
