# File Routing and Nested Endpoint
- Next js application of frontend and backend.

### If we want create a new endpoint: 
- just create file.js, that a new endpoints yours...
- i.e about.js is your <b>youdomain.com/about</b> endpoint

### Nested Endpoint 
- like we have multiple endpoint corresponding the problem.
- may we have sometimes multiple endpoints related to auth, buy
- here nested api endpoints same like frontend api endpoints.

    auth --> login, signup, createuser endpoints so we can using auth folder we can manage multiple endpoints. 

    endponts look like then : 
    yourdomain.com/auth/login
    yourdomain.com/auth/signup
    yourdomain.com/auth/createuser
